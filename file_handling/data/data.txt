Born on 24 November 1968 in the village of Galewela in the Central Province of Sri Lanka, Dissanayake
moved with his family to the village of Thambuththegama in the North Central Province in 1972.[8]
While he was a student at the University of Peradeniya, he joined the Socialist Students Union,
the student wing of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) as a student when the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord
was signed in 1987[9] and engaged in clandestine revolutionary activity until he was forced to go
underground due to threats posed by the counterinsurgency operations undertaken by the government.
A year later, he transferred to the University of Kelaniya. After he was awarded his bachelor's degree
in science at the University of Kelaniya in 1995,
he was elected the national organiser of the Socialist Students Union in 1997.[10]
